## üê¶ Dataset

This directory contains the curated dataset used for training and evaluating the bird vocalization classifier in **Birdify**. The dataset has been cleaned and refined to ensure high-quality data for accurate model performance.


### üìÑ `Birds_Voice.csv`

This CSV file contains metadata for each bird vocalization sample. It was compiled and curated from the [Xeno-Canto](https://xeno-canto.org/) bird sound archive, ensuring:
- Consistent formatting
- Sufficient audio length
- Valid and high-quality recordings
- Proper labeling and species verification
