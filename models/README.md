## üß† Trained Models

This directory contains all the trained models used in **Birdify**, including classical machine learning models (like KNN and SVM) and deep learning models (CNN and AFCNN). These models were generated from the training and evaluation process described in the [`notebooks/`](../notebooks) directory.

Each file corresponds to a model or associated artifact (e.g., scalers or metadata) used for prediction and evaluation.

### üîí Notes

- Models are saved in various formats depending on the framework:
  - `.h5` for Keras-based models (CNNs and AFCNN).
  - `.pkl` for Scikit-learn models (KNN and SVM).
- For inference or further evaluation, make sure to load the correct preprocessor (e.g., scalers) along with the model.
- Metadata in `model_metadata.json` can help reproduce the model setup or assist in deployment.
