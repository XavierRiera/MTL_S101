## üìä Model Metrics

This directory contains the evaluation metrics and training history for all models trained in the **Birdify** project. These artifacts help analyze and compare model performance both visually and quantitatively.

The metrics are organized by model type: KNN, SVM, CNN, and AFCNN.

### üìå Notes

- Confusion matrices are provided as `.png` images for quick visual inspection of classification results.
- Evaluation metrics are stored in `.json` format to allow easy parsing and integration in reports or dashboards.
- Training histories help monitor model convergence and identify overfitting or underfitting trends.
